The gRPC endpoint provides a service for adding new location of a person.
The format of defined message and service is as the following:

message Location {
  int32 id = 1;
  int32 person_id = 2;
  string longitude = 3;
  string latitude = 4;
  string creation_time = 5;
}

service LocationService {
    rpc Create(Location) returns (Location);
}

The following code snipet shows how to interact with location service:

import grpc
import location_pb2
import location_pb2_grpc

channel = grpc.insecure_channel("localhost:30005")
stub = location_pb2_grpc.LocationServiceStub(channel)

location = location_pb2.Location(
    id=1,
    person_id=5,
    latitude="-122.290524",
    longitude="37.553441",
    creation_time="1970-01-01T10:10:10Z"
)

response = stub.Create(location)
